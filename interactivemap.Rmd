## Leaflet Map

Here is an interactive map displaying locations:

```{r}
library(leaflet)

# Sample data
locations <- data.frame(
  lat = c(37.7749, 40.7128, 51.5074),
  lon = c(-122.4194, -74.0060, -0.1278),
  city = c("San Francisco", "New York", "London")
)

# Create the map
leaflet(locations) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(~lon, ~lat, popup = ~city)

```
